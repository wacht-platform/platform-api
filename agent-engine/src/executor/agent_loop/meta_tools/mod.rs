Last resort: prefer resolving via other tools, context, or a sensible default. Ends the turn; pauses until answered; one pending set at a time. Each question: `id`, `text`, `answer_kind`. \
            \n\nPick `answer_kind.kind` by the SHAPE of the answer, not by how many words it is:\
            \n- single_choice — exactly one selection from a known finite set (choices REQUIRED, allow_other? when the set might be incomplete). DEFAULT for 'which/pick/select one' phrasing. Use even for 2-option questions that aren't literal yes/no (e.g. 'staging or production?').\
            \n- multi_choice — zero-or-more selections (choices REQUIRED, min_selected? max_selected?). Use ONLY when 'select all that apply' is the natural framing: feature toggles, integrations to enable, tags, days of week. Never set `max_selected: 1` — that's single_choice. If at least one must be picked, set `min_selected: 1` rather than reframing.\
            \n- yes_no — literal yes/no. Prefer over single_choice for binary boolean questions.\
            \n- confirm — irreversible/destructive action gate ('Delete', 'Send'); REQUIRES confirm_label + cancel_label. Not for general questions.\
            \n- free_text — open-ended; use when the option space is unknown, unbounded, or freeform (a name, a description, a URL). If you can enumerate 3-7 plausible options, prefer single_choice with allow_other.\
            \n- number (min?, max?, unit?) — numeric input.\
            \n- date (yyyy-mm-dd, min_date?, max_date?).\
            \n\nFor choice kinds: order options by likelihood (most common first), keep `label` short, use `description` only for one-line disambiguation. Optional top-level `context` explains why you're asking."
